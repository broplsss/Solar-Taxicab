Welcome to Solar Taxicab, the game where you fairy passengers from planet to planet, avoid and shoot aliens, and try and make a huge amount of money. Try to unlock all 4 bonus planets! Make sure you're utilizing the shop and unlock the bonus planets because passengers seeking those planets as their destination will pay far more than normal passengers.

“Great entry! Incremental games seem like the perfect genre for this theme, and the execution was super unique, with the space exploration and combat aspect keeping me hooked.” — PolyMars

My entry into the Repl.it Kajam. I'm so stocked that I got Most Theme Fitting. Make sure you use the shop.
