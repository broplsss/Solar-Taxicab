hey theo

this will be a temp todo list

right now im making the .pedit sprites in grayscale for the:
- planets: 3 different planets, transformations of rotation and scale can be done afterward
- cargo/people

and also the .pedit sprites for the different ship sizes
i'll do a couple stages for now
i'm also going to make each ship have a flame frame animation

unlockable planets yield more profit
